# Why I'm Excited to become a SE:
  * I'm eager to learn how to code, since virtually anything is possible once you know what you're doing!
  * I have my eyes set on creating my own company, and this is the first step in that journey.
  * Problem solving is very enjoyable, and I love the feeling of finally completeing a task.
  * I have many peers in the field of computer programming, and I love that I can now engage in meaningful conversation with them!
  * I can't wait to learn JavaScript, since I spent many years coding in an alternate version of this style.
